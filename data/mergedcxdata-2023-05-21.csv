New business owners need help determining the appropriate business structure for their venture, how to develop a business plan, and identifying/accessing sources of funds to support the creation of their business.

FEMA assistance can be financial (e.g., payments to help with expenses for temporary housing, home repairs, personal property, transportation or medical expenses caused by the disaster), direct (e.g., lodging or temporary housing provided by FEMA), or can be provided through partners (e.g., disaster unemployment assistance, legal services, and connection to voluntary agencies). Customers for this service are the individuals and families who need help with necessary expenses and disaster-caused unmet needs that are not covered by insurance or other sources. While personal insurance is the first line of support after a natural disaster, some populations may be underinsured or uninsured and may have disaster-related needs that insurance does not cover. FEMA services are not meant to compensate for all disaster-caused losses and cannot replace insurance coverage. However, they still provide critical assistance to disaster survivors, allowing them to begin their recovery process.","FEMA’s mission is to help people before, during and after disasters. 2020 set a new annual record of 22 “billion dollar” disasters - for the first time in the history, FEMA responded to simultaneous disasters in Washington, D.C., five territories and all 50 states for a record 230 presidentially declared emergencies, supporting more than 25 million people affected by natural disasters."

",78,Managing Individual Indian Monies (IIM) accounts,,"Individual Indian Monies (IIM) accountholder’s have an IIM account established for them by BTFA.  An Individual Indian Money (IIM) account is an interest-bearing account managed by BTFA on behalf of an individual who has money or other assets held in trust for them by the Federal government. An Individual Indian often inherits fractional owner interests through either a will or a probate process. Also, trust land ownership can be acquired through a purchase or a gift deed. 

Managing IIM accounts usually begins with a compelling beneficiary “life need” to access the monetary assets held in their IIM account to pay for necessities like utilities, housing, food, and medical needs. The beneficiary may engage with BTFA in a few different ways. The beneficiary may check the balance and recent transaction history, update account information with a new address or change disbursement instructions, access the trust funds that have posted into IIM account, make a request for disbursement of funds from their account. The beneficiary may also seek information about their interests in tracts of land so that they can make informed decisions about managing the asset.
","Bureau of Trust Funds Administration (BTFA) manages over $8.2 billion in monetary trust assets, and delivers trust funds accounting and management services to Indian trust beneficiaries.  BTFA’s trust responsibilities include holding funds for Tribes and funds for individuals (i.e., Individual Indian Monies (IIM) accounts). Tribal and Other Trust Funds are comprised of approximately 4,100 accounts with monetary assets of approximately $6.8 billion and over 408,000 Individual Indian Monies (IIM) accounts with monetary assets of approximately $1.4 billion.

FEMA assistance can be financial (e.g., payments to help with expenses for temporary housing, home repairs, personal property, transportation or medical expenses caused by the disaster), direct (e.g., lodging or temporary housing provided by FEMA), or can be provided through partners (e.g., disaster unemployment assistance, legal services, and connection to voluntary agencies). Customers for this service are the individuals and families who need help with necessary expenses and disaster-caused unmet needs that are not covered by insurance or other sources. While personal insurance is the first line of support after a natural disaster, some populations may be underinsured or uninsured and may have disaster-related needs that insurance does not cover. FEMA services are not meant to compensate for all disaster-caused losses and cannot replace insurance coverage. However, they still provide critical assistance to disaster survivors, allowing them to begin their recovery process.","FEMA’s mission is to help people before, during and after disasters. 2020 set a new annual record of 22 “billion dollar” disasters - for the first time in the history, FEMA responded to simultaneous disasters in Washington, D.C., five territories and all 50 states for a record 230 presidentially declared emergencies, supporting more than 25 million people affected by natural disasters."

These funds or fractional owner interests are often inherited by an individual, through either a will or a probate process. Land interests can also be acquired through a gift deed process. Not every individual American Indian is an IIM accountholder.

We interact with our beneficiaries principally through four occasions: when they need current information regarding their trust and monetary assets (balance, recent transaction history, timing of expected payment, etc.), when they need to update their account information, when they have an immediate need to access the trust revenue funds, and when they need information about their interests in tracts of land so that they can make informed decisions related to estate planning, financial planning, gift deeds, consenting to land use, or participating in land consolidation efforts. ","Bureau of Trust Funds Administration (BTFA) manages over $8.2 billion in monetary trust assets, and delivers trust funds accounting and management services to Indian trust beneficiaries.  BTFA’s trust responsibilities include holding funds for Tribes and funds for individuals (i.e., Individual Indian Monies (IIM) accounts). Tribal and Other Trust Funds are comprised of approximately 4,100 accounts with monetary assets of approximately $6.8 billion and over 408,000 Individual Indian Monies (IIM) accounts with monetary assets of approximately $1.4 billion.

",78,Managing Individual Indian Monies (IIM) accounts,,"Individual Indian Monies (IIM) accountholder’s have an IIM account established for them by BTFA.  An Individual Indian Money (IIM) account is an interest-bearing account managed by BTFA on behalf of an individual who has money or other assets held in trust for them by the Federal government. An Individual Indian often inherits fractional owner interests through either a will or a probate process. Also, trust land ownership can be acquired through a purchase or a gift deed. 

Managing IIM accounts usually begins with a compelling beneficiary “life need” to access the monetary assets held in their IIM account to pay for necessities like utilities, housing, food, and medical needs. The beneficiary may engage with BTFA in a few different ways. The beneficiary may check the balance and recent transaction history, update account information with a new address or change disbursement instructions, access the trust funds that have posted into IIM account, make a request for disbursement of funds from their account. The beneficiary may also seek information about their interests in tracts of land so that they can make informed decisions about managing the asset.

 2.	The Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation (DEEOIC) annually services over 25,000 beneficiaries with approximately $1.8 billion in lump-sum compensation and medical benefit payments.

In addition, DCMWC monitors benefits paid by responsible coal mine operators to another 9,000 beneficiaries. 

 4.	The Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation program annually services over 35,000 beneficiaries and oversees the payment of approximately $1.3 billion in compensation and medical benefits.

These funds or fractional owner interests are often inherited by an individual, through either a will or a probate process. Land interests can also be acquired through a gift deed process. Not every individual American Indian is an IIM accountholder.

We interact with our beneficiaries principally through four occasions: when they need current information regarding their trust and monetary assets (balance, recent transaction history, timing of expected payment, etc.), when they need to update their account information, when they have an immediate need to access the trust revenue funds, and when they need information about their interests in tracts of land so that they can make informed decisions related to estate planning, financial planning, gift deeds, consenting to land use, or participating in land consolidation efforts. ","Bureau of Trust Funds Administration (BTFA) manages over $8.2 billion in monetary trust assets, and delivers trust funds accounting and management services to Indian trust beneficiaries.  BTFA’s trust responsibilities include holding funds for Tribes and funds for individuals (i.e., Individual Indian Monies (IIM) accounts).

",78,Managing Individual Indian Monies (IIM) accounts,,"Individual Indian Monies (IIM) accountholder’s have an IIM account established for them by BTFA.  An Individual Indian Money (IIM) account is an interest-bearing account managed by BTFA on behalf of an individual who has money or other assets held in trust for them by the Federal government. An Individual Indian often inherits fractional owner interests through either a will or a probate process. Also, trust land ownership can be acquired through a purchase or a gift deed. 

Managing IIM accounts usually begins with a compelling beneficiary “life need” to access the monetary assets held in their IIM account to pay for necessities like utilities, housing, food, and medical needs. The beneficiary may engage with BTFA in a few different ways. The beneficiary may check the balance and recent transaction history, update account information with a new address or change disbursement instructions, access the trust funds that have posted into IIM account, make a request for disbursement of funds from their account. The beneficiary may also seek information about their interests in tracts of land so that they can make informed decisions about managing the asset.
","Bureau of Trust Funds Administration (BTFA) manages over $8.2 billion in monetary trust assets, and delivers trust funds accounting and management services to Indian trust beneficiaries.  BTFA’s trust responsibilities include holding funds for Tribes and funds for individuals (i.e., Individual Indian Monies (IIM) accounts). Tribal and Other Trust Funds are comprised of approximately 4,100 accounts with monetary assets of approximately $6.8 billion and over 408,000 Individual Indian Monies (IIM) accounts with monetary assets of approximately $1.4 billion.

These funds or fractional owner interests are often inherited by an individual, through either a will or a probate process. Land interests can also be acquired through a gift deed process. Not every individual American Indian is an IIM accountholder.

We interact with our beneficiaries principally through four occasions: when they need current information regarding their trust and monetary assets (balance, recent transaction history, timing of expected payment, etc.), when they need to update their account information, when they have an immediate need to access the trust revenue funds, and when they need information about their interests in tracts of land so that they can make informed decisions related to estate planning, financial planning, gift deeds, consenting to land use, or participating in land consolidation efforts.

An Individual Indian Money (IIM) account is an interest-bearing account managed by BTFA on behalf of an individual who has money or other assets held in trust for them by the Federal government. An Individual Indian often inherits fractional owner interests through either a will or a probate process. Also, trust land ownership can be acquired through a purchase or a gift deed. 

Managing IIM accounts usually begins with a compelling beneficiary “life need” to access the monetary assets held in their IIM account to pay for necessities like utilities, housing, food, and medical needs. The beneficiary may engage with BTFA in a few different ways. The beneficiary may check the balance and recent transaction history, update account information with a new address or change disbursement instructions, access the trust funds that have posted into IIM account, make a request for disbursement of funds from their account. The beneficiary may also seek information about their interests in tracts of land so that they can make informed decisions about managing the asset.

FEMA assistance can be financial (e.g., payments to help with expenses for temporary housing, home repairs, personal property, transportation or medical expenses caused by the disaster), direct (e.g., lodging or temporary housing provided by FEMA), or can be provided through partners (e.g., disaster unemployment assistance, legal services, and connection to voluntary agencies). Customers for this service are the individuals and families who need help with necessary expenses and disaster-caused unmet needs that are not covered by insurance or other sources. While personal insurance is the first line of support after a natural disaster, some populations may be underinsured or uninsured and may have disaster-related needs that insurance does not cover. FEMA services are not meant to compensate for all disaster-caused losses and cannot replace insurance coverage. However, they still provide critical assistance to disaster survivors, allowing them to begin their recovery process.","FEMA’s mission is to help people before, during and after disasters. 2020 set a new annual record of 22 “billion dollar” disasters - for the first time in the history, FEMA responded to simultaneous disasters in Washington, D.C., five territories and all 50 states for a record 230 presidentially declared emergencies, supporting more than 25 million people affected by natural disasters."
